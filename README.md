# Introduction To Foundation Presentation

This is the **Introduction To Foundation** presentation made at the [7hills Software Developer's Group](http://www.meetup.com/Maker-Cities-Northwest-GA/events/132524422/) on August 15th, 2013.

## Viewing The Presentation

Just go to: http://saidigital.github.io/intro-to-foundation/

It's best viewed on a desktop due to the responsive examples that I try to embed within the presentation, ironic given that this is a presentation for a responsive framework.

## Downloading The Presentation

If you want to view the slides on your machine, you can clone the pre-built slides at the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/saidigital/intro-to-foundation/tree/gh-pages)

You can also get the repo without git [here](https://github.com/saidigital/intro-to-foundation/archive/gh-pages.zip).

## Building The Presentation Yourself

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed, and from a terminal run the following from the root of the project directory: `npm install && bower install`

Then, also from the root of the project directory, start the server: `grunt server`

You should now be able to access the slides from `http://localhost:9000`.
