##  I've also heard of Twitter Bootstrap?

Twitter Bootstrap is great for the same reasons! It provides many of the same components that Foundation has, and more.

We generally use Foundation for lighter projects like WordPress and static sites, not that it couldn't be utilized in a giant web application.

The really big difference between the two is the grid-system. We prefer Foundation's, but the latest release candidate of Bootstrap now has a very similar system.
