##  I've also heard of Twitter Bootstrap?

* Twitter Bootstrap is great for the same reasons! 
* It provides many of the same components that Foundation has, and more.
* We generally use Foundation for lighter projects like WordPress and static sites, not that it couldn't be utilized in a giant web application.
* The really big difference between the two is the grid system. We prefer Foundation's, but the latest release candidate of Bootstrap now has a very similar system.
* As with any "cool new tool," try it out yourself and decide what works best for *your* given use case.
