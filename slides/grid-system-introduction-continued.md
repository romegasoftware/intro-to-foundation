## The Responsive Grid Cont'd

* The small grid is the same as the large grid, but it will allow you to specify column widths at and below the 768px width breakpoint. This is meant for further customizing the layout for mobile devices.
* Up to 16 columns can be utilized, but the default is 12.
* You can also change content or hide columns when switching between the two systems.
