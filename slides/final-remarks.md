##  Final Remarks

* We mostly covered the grid, probably the most challenging part of Foundation. The rest really is pretty easy.
* Any heavy customization of Foundation requires knowledge of Sass. Sass really is a presentation on its own, which is why we didn't cover customization or sass.
* ZURB generally keeps their documentation for Foundation, and is pretty good: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/
* If you want to inspect the Foundation source further, or file a bug, Foundation is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/zurb/foundation
