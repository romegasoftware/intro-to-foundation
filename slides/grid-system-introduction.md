## The Responsive Grid

* The grid consists of rows and columns, which can be infinitely nested. 
* The columns are always of equal divisions of the total width of the row.
* Foundation 4 now comes with two different responsive grids for layout, the large and the small.
* If you are familiar with Foundation 3, the large grid in Foundation 4 is the same as the 12 column responsive grid in Foundation 3.
With this grid, if the screen is > 768px wide, it will show the columns as normal. Below that, it stacks the columns on top of each other.
