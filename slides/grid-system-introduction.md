* Foundation 4 now comes with two different responsive grids for layout, the large and the small.
* If you are familiar with Foundation 3, the large grid in Foundation 4 is the same as the 12 column responsive grid in Foundation 3.
With this grid, if the screen is > 768px wide, it will show the columns as normal. Below that, it stacks the columns on top of each other.
* The small grid is the same as the large grid, but it will allow you to specify column widths at and below the 768px width breakpoint. This is meant for further customizing the layout for mobile devices.
* Up to 16 columns can be utilized, but the default is 12.
* You can also change content or hide columns switching between the two systems.
